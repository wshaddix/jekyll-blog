Hi, I’m Wes — a Solution Architect, Software Engineering Manager, and lifelong learner.  

Over the past **24 years**, I’ve designed enterprise-scale systems, led high-performing engineering teams, and helped organizations turn complex challenges into elegant, scalable solutions. My career has taken me from writing code in the trenches to shaping technical strategy at the highest level — and along the way, I’ve learned that great technology is built by great teams.  

This blog is where I share what I’ve learned (and am still learning) about:  
- **Solution Architecture** — designing systems that last  
- **Technical Leadership** — guiding teams through change and growth  
- **Team Building** — creating cultures where engineers thrive  
- **Engineering Excellence** — balancing speed, quality, and innovation  

I believe the best solutions happen when **technology and people** are in sync — when architecture supports agility, and leadership empowers creativity.  

Whether you’re an engineer looking to grow into leadership, a manager navigating technical decisions, or a fellow architect seeking fresh perspectives, I hope you’ll find ideas here that help you **build better systems and stronger teams**.
